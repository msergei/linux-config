# Ubuntu-base system on Huawei Matebook X Pro
Do you install some ubuntu-base system on your Huawei Matebook X Pro? It's great, but you need a couple of scripts to finish configurate it! Tested on elementary os 5.1.

## How to install utils?

1.Please, execute command in you terminal:
> bash ./utils-install.sh

This script will add: Matebook-Applet, Intel Undervoult Gui, psensor (temperature control) and many other.

2.And then add 'matebook-applet' and 'psensor' command to autostart. Unfortunately, at the moment I сould not automate this.

## How to add gestures to your system like MacOS?

1.Please, execute command in you terminal:

> bash ./fusuma-install.sh

2.And then add 'fusuma' command to autostart. Unfortunately, at the moment I сould not automate this.
